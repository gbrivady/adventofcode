# Advent of Code

Each folder corresponds to a year.
Current year is also the root folder, for which each folder corresponds to a day. I try to stick to one language per year.

## Advent of Code 2023
Language for this year will be `rust`! To run day `xx`, simply do `cargo run --bin xx` from the root folder.

## Progression

List of every day, with every challenge. The mark is my opinion on my solution : 1 is minimal effort, working solution, 2 is for a more fancy one, and 3 is when I tried to clean the code afterwards and do some fancy stuff.
Time is `hh:mm:ss`, and using a separate timer - as `UTC-5` is a bit rough.

### Remarks

- I think day 09 can be done with a one liner by calling several maps on iterators, and I tried to get as close as possible to that - but I think I failed
