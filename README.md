# Advent of Code 2022

Each folder of each day corresponds to a different language for a solution. Most of them are C, but some have other languages.

## Progression

List of every day, with every challenge. The mark is my opinion on my solution : 1 is minimal effort, working solution, 2 is for a more fancy one, and 3 is when I tried to clean the code afterwards and do some fancy stuff.
Time is `hh:mm:ss`, and using a separate timer - as `UTC-5` is a bit rough.

### Remarks

- Day 13: had an issue with parsing the output using `mingw-gcc` on Windows, so no C solution. Retimed only the part where I did `python` code
